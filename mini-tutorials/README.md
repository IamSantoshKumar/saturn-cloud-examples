# Mini Tutorials

Our users and customers sometimes have questions about how to complete a particular task or set of tasks efficiently in Dask. The notebooks in this folder contain handy tips and walkthroughs for this kind of work.

If you have a request for a mini-tutorial subject, or a question you'd like us to answer in a notebook, please [join our community Slack and let us know](https://www.saturncloud.io/s/join-slack)!

These notebooks assume you are working inside the Saturn Cloud environment. If you haven't made an account, please [join our Hosted product with a free trial to get started](https://www.saturncloud.io/s/)!
